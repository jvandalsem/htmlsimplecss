        <h2>Social Media Tracker</h2>
        <p>This project I sought to successfully utilize 5 API's into one program, and create visual representations of my own social media data. I was able to use the Google Maps, Google Mail, GroupMe, Facebook, and Instagram APIs to create a
          rounded
          look at the data, while storing it into an SQL database. I then sought to create visual outputs of the data I got from these 5 APIs, using the Pandas (left), Plotly (bottom left), and Matplotlib (bottom right) modules. I was able to
          efficiently implement all of these tools and created a functional social media tracker. The raw code for this project can be found and downloaded below.</p>

        <h2>Weather AI Chat Bot</h2>
        <p>This program is a creative artificial intelligence weather chat bot. Through the implementation of AIML files, I was able to successfully engage in conversation with the bot, as well as ask it some weather questions. As you can see, you
          can
          ask it basic queries, but can also ask about the weather and receive live forecast updates. The entire project was built in a Python text editor, with the help from Google and Darkskynet API's. The raw code for this project can be found
          and
          downloaded below.</p>

        <h2>Restaurant Review Site</h2>
        <p>My program allows users to search and save restaurants located in Ann Arbor, and gets these restaurants' data from the Yelp Fusion API. Users then have the option to do a few other things with these searched and saved restaurants. ALL
          users
          can view ALL restaurants saved from ALL users, along with the rating and price range of the restaurant(from Yelp API). Registered and logged in users can make a collection of restaurants, and can include/select all previously saved
          restaurants. Registered and logged in users can make a review about a restaurant/experience/meal, and sequentially rate the review on a scale from 1-5. Registered and logged in users can then view their own collections and reviews, and
          perform
          changes to both. Registered and logged in users can delete their own collections, and can update the rating of a restaurant review.</p>

        <h2>NFL Weather and Odds Analysis</h2>
        <p>My project​​ incorporates a dataset of NFL games that contains odds, scores, and weather from 1966 through the current 2018 season, and an NFL API from Sports Radar that gathers loads of live data from the NFL which also includes fields
          like
          games, odds, scores, and weather, from the years 2001-2018. My goal​​ was to join the two sets of data, to try and accurately determine NFL team regular season performances in specific weather conditions, based off of my own categorization
          of
          weather types. I will then use this data to see how often each team is ‘favored’ or chosen to win, prior to playing in each of these game conditions. I am looking at this comparison, because weather is usually a predicted variable, like
          choosing a team winner.</p>
